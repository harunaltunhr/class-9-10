# Tiago Mendes-Costa

Born in Luxembourg from Belgian and Portuguese parents, I moved to Brussels at the age of 6.

I was a computer geek during my teens, and discovered programming with the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) language. Later tried various [Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) languages, [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and other more obscure ones during my studies. After a brief game developer career, I moved to web development with [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), and then [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)). 

I work at [Spreds](https://www.spreds.com/en), a small company that organizes private funding between local entrepreneurs and investors, doing web development with the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) framework.

In addition to HYF, I also try to help with the [RubyBelgium](https://rubybelgium.be) organization and the [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) Brussels events.
