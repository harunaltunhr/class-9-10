 ####  About me  
---

 Hi everyone! Glad to meet you! 
    My name is ` Pavel Bidenko `. I am Ukrainian. I live in Brussels for two years.

<br>
    
####  Working experience 
---
As to my experience in IT, I've got some certain knoweledges in Java and data bases. I hope that the sense of OOP principles would help me to master frontend development.

<br>

#### Hobbies 
---
 I'm fond of active way of life. I like cycling, travelling, sight-seeing,  hand-crafting, friends-meeting etc...

 <br>

 #### Wishes & desires
--- 
To my mind it is not a great task to learn coding basics. Almost everybody can master it.  
My wish is to get a good experience in close-to-life and real tasks development - modern frameworks and API-s, pair and team co-working, i.e. how do they develop in the software companiens :wink:  

And of course, I wish you good health, good luck and happiness!
