## Background

   I've 15 years of experience in art, with the main focus in classical music, cinema and art and technology. My first programming experience when I was around 4 years old and my father bought a [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX). Altough I was not capable to understand nothing of what I was doing, my father brought books that came with pages and pages with codes, so together with my sister we passed all the day writting code in a black screen with green characters. After hours writting "0100" and other things, we execute the program. At this moment we spend other couple of hours debugging the several "syntax error in line xxx" that appears. With lucky, after long time we get to make it work properly and we are able to save it (in a cassette tape)! 

   After this early experience I develop my carrer in the field of arts, but in some way always working on the intersection of art and technology. Since 2011 I started to get closer to web development, first learning some basics (Wordpress / HTML) and since 2018 I started a path to take more seriously the IT learning.
