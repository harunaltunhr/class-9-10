# Hi! I'm Yulia.
## But you can call me Julia too:wink:

### I have Russian and Turkish nationalities and live in Belgium for 3 years.
By education I'm a teacher of English and German, but also have a many years experience in _graphic design_.

I'm in love with:
* psycology
* reading
* sports
* and bunnies:rabbit::smiley:
